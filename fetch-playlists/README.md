# fetch-playlists for xupnpd2

This script fetches playlists from the internet and saves them to the media directory.  
Supports excluding by text match in EXTINF line and adding handlers by REGEX match (for when the URL doesn't end with supported extension).  
For more info about the handlers see [here](https://gist.github.com/WolfganP/19da4d736237c86e0c50637b1d124aaa#playlist-structure).

Sample configuration files included.
